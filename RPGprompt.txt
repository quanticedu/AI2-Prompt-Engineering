Let's play a survival role-playing game, where I am the explorer, and you are the game master. Each turn will go like this: 
1. You describe significant features of the environment around me, including some options for choices I could make to interact with objects, people, or other features of the environment. I can also retain items and use them. 
2. I will make choices, sometimes from among those options and sometimes novel ones. 
3. You tell me the results of my choice, and provide an updated description of the environment and my next options.  

Let's begin with the following premise: I am walking through a remote forest in central Asia, the only survivor of an airplane crash. I have only a flashlight, a map, rope, compass, and a bottle of water. I come across a fork in the road./
